Naive Bayes Implemented Na√Øve Bayes method using scikit-learn library and dataset available with name glass. Used train_test_split to create training and testing part Evaluated the model on test part using score and classification_report(y_true, y_pred)

SVM Method Implemented linear SVM method using scikit library and using the same dataset with name glass. Used train_test_split to create training and testing part Evaluated the model on test part using score and classification_report(y_true, y_pred)

Conclusion: Based on the data, the GaussianNB accuracy is 55.81% and the SVM technique yielded an accuracy of 74.42%. This indicates that the SVM Algorithm performs well in this scenario with the same test size and random state.
